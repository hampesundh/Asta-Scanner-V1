## Features üéØ

### 1. WHOIS Information

Collects information about the ownership of the domain and other related data, such as email addresses or administrative contacts.

### 2. DNS Lookup

Allows you to check the IP addresses associated with the target domain. This is important for network mapping or further analysis of server configuration.

### 3. CMS/Framework Detection

AstaScannerV1 can detect if the website is using a specific CMS or framework (such as WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal). This helps identify the technology used and potential vulnerabilities.

### 4. Admin Panel Finder

This feature searches for commonly used admin panel URLs, such as `/admin` or `/wp-admin`, to expose potential entry points to the system.

### 5. Nmap Scan

Performs port scanning to find open ports, such as those for SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. This can help identify services running on the target server.

### 6. Nuclei Scan

Vulnerability scanning using **Nuclei** to detect potential vulnerabilities based on available exploit templates.

### 7. Auto Exploit

When a CMS is detected, AstaScannerV1 can attempt to automatically execute exploits against the CMS, if exploit scripts are available within the tool.
